# Advanced-Parking-Slot-Iot-Project
The IoT Parking Slot Detection System aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly way to manage parking spaces. By leveraging a combination of hardware components, we can detect whether a parking slot is occupied or available and communicate this information over the internet. The system is designed for ease of use and can be expanded or adapted to fit various parking scenarios.

Features
Real-time occupancy detection using IR sensors
Wireless communication via NodeMCU 8266
Easy-to-understand code included
Scalable design for up to multiple parking slots

Components Used:
Arduino Nano
NodeMCU 8266
IR sensors (for detecting vehicle presence)
Jumper wires and breadboards for connections
